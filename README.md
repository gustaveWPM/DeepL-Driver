# DeepL Driver

Custom DeepL Driver designed to do the fewer API Calls as possible. Compatible with string arrays input, string inputs, and Record<string, string> inputs.
Backend & Frontend compatible (even if it is discouraged to use DeepL API calls from a frontend), via a Cors.sh proxy if needed.
